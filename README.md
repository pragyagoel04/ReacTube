# ReacTube
A reactJS application to search and stream youtube videos without looking at the unwanted suggested/trending videos.

### In this I have used:

#### Class Based Components
Generally used when we want to have the concept of state in the component.

#### Functional Components
Where we don't have states and the function returns a static value.
Example, videoList, VideoListItem

#### Callbacks
For parent-child communication.
